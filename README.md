# Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)
This a repository containing various Data Structures and Algorithms code that can be used as a companion repository for introductory and advanced courses.

The repository is divided into folders based on topics (*e.g.*, data structures, greedy algorithms, ...) and each folder contains on folder for each algorithms or data structure type.

All code is written in Python in order to keep it simple and clear. The coding style is not necessarily pythonic as it is designed to provide clear understanding of the algorithms. All code is designed to work with only the standard library of Python (although they are typically tested against the latest version).
